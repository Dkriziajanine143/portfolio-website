    <h2>About Me </h2>
      <p>I'm Krizia Janine F. Donceras, 19 years of age, I was born on June 16,2004.<br>
         I lived in Brgy. Hamorawon Purok-4, Calbayog City. I studied in Northwest<br>
         Samar State University, taking up the course in Bachelor of Science in<br>
         Information System.
         <br>
        I am shy but not necessarily an introvert. I enjoy being with close friends <br>
        and can be very social in familiar settings or with people I know. However, <br>
        I feel anxious about attending social events where I don't know anyone, <br>
        even if I might enjoy them. It's a challenging situation for shy individuals <br>
        who are not introverted, as we appreciate social interactions but find it <br>
        overwhelming to put ourselves out there in unfamiliar situations.
